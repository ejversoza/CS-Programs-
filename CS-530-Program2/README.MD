Class Information: CS 530 Section #01, Spring 2019
Assignment Information: Assignment #2
Filename: README.txt
File Manifest: xed.cpp, xed.h, main.cpp, opcode.cpp, opcode.h, README.txt, Makefile, sample.obj, sample.sym, SoftwareDesignDocument.txt
Compile Instructions: make 

To Clean: make clean

Operating Instructions: ./xed sample.obj

List of Design Decisions: 
1.Organization of the files to perform different parts of disassembling
 
List of Extra Features: 
1.Error checked if the files were correct

List of Known Deficiencies/Bugs: 
1.The output for the XE listing file has some formatting errors
2.Our modification record may have errors

List of Lesson Learned: 
1.Better overall understanding of how the XE disassembler operates 
2.Formulating the algorithms to manipulate the object code and its accompanying symbol file to generate the XE source and listing files using the disassembled code
3.Working with many files to produce the desired output 
4.Learning how to effectively communicate as a team of three
